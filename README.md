<H1>AutoNotes</H1>

This program creates, saves and opens a file whilst echoing the name and date of creation.

This program is currently setup to work from Command Prompt on Windows, but I am currently working on a shell script that does the same.

<h2><b>How it works?</b></h2>

Type into CMD:

<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">note FileName FileType</span></code>

<h2><b> Requirements</b></h2>

In order for the script to work correctly you need to pick the location where you want your notes to be saved and put the Path into your ENVIRONMENTS.

You will also need to update the .bat file with your folder names for it to function correctly.
